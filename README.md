### 

This piece of code is an animation based on mathematical functions, mainly using functions such as sin and cos to create a cool animation effect. It was ported from coding one week3 Homework to C++ and Openframeworks. By using the mouse to move up and down or left and right, users can control the amplitude and deformation of the animation, enhancing interactivity and fun. At the same time, the background color also changes with the movement of the mouse, making the entire animation more vivid and lively.

This work has rich color and animation changes, constantly changing and deforming, bringing users visual enjoyment and interactive fun. Users can control the effect of the animation at any time, enhancing the sense of participation and autonomy. Overall, this piece of code is a very interesting and creative interactive animation that can attract people's attention and make them feel full of fun and surprise.

## 02-OF-Boids


"Assimilation" is a programming project based on a particle system that uses classes and inheritance to implement interactions and collision effects between different types of particles. The parent class of this project uses the Boid class provided by the instructor, with particles that are blue-green in color and have random sizes. In addition to this, I have created two subclasses, one of which is childBoid, with yellow-colored particles that inherit from the parent class with less code. I have also overridden some functions and parameters to make the animation effect of the childBoid class different from the parent class. Furthermore, I have also passed parameters between childBoid and the parent Boid class, allowing the particles of the two classes to interact with each other. The movement direction of the particles will be affected by each other, and they will collide when they intersect.

The other subclass is flowerBoid, which generates pink square-shaped particles when dragged by the mouse. These particles are affected by gravity, falling to the ground and bouncing back up. When they collide with Boid particles, they change to a similar blue-green color, while collisions with childBoid particles change them to a yellow color.

By using classes and inheritance, I have successfully created a unique particle system that allows particles of different types to interact with each other and collide. This design not only increases the fun of the game but also helps to gain a deeper understanding of the application of classes and inheritance in programming.
